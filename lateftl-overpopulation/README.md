# Late FTL - Overpopulation

This mod creates a new civic - "Overpopulated". This civic cannot be removed
after game starts.

The mod does three things

1. The empire start with all free tiles on their home world populated
2. The empire starts with a free [Orbital Habitat](http://www.stellariswiki.com/Megastructures#Habitats)
3. The empire starts with the technology to build Orbital Habitats

This represents a race that have tried to solve the population growth 
problem with orbital cities before the advent of the FTL drive.
