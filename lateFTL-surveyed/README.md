# Late FTL - Surveyed

This mod simple lets you start with your home system surveyed.

It seems unlikely to me that a race would not have developed engines
that allow them to explore their own solar system somewhat before they
develop Faster-Than-Light travel.

## How the mod works

On day 1, an event is triggered that makes the entire system surveyed.

This event should trigger for all races (countries).
