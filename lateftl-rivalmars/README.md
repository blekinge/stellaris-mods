# Late FTL - Rival Mars

This mod tries to recreate the setting from the The Expanse (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(novel_series)>
and <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)>).

In this setting humanity, Earth have been unified under the [UN](http://www.stellariswiki.com/Preset_empires#United_Nations_of_Earth)
and the terraforming of Mars is underway. Mars have rebelled against Earth and gained independence. Their culture is well
represented by the [Commonwealth of Man](http://www.stellariswiki.com/Preset_empires#Commonwealth_of_Man).

In this mod, Mars have been terraformed to a desert type planet (to represent that population living in domes). Mars starts
with an ongoing terraforming project.

Earth starts with all tiles populated to represent the serious overpopulation that threatened the planet.

The United Nations starts with Earth as their capitol, while the Commonwealth of Man starts with Mars as their capitol.
